# An Introduction to PyBioProx

PyBioProx is a simple tool built in Python to analyze the relative proximity between fluorescent biomarkers in 2D or 3D microscopy images. 
For example, this can be used to analyse whether the distance between fluorescently labelled organelles or proteins (e.g. the distance
between mitochondria and the nucleus) changes according to experimental parameters. PyBioProx generates perimeter distance (PD) measurments (defined [here](url))
which represent the shortest distance between a perimeter pixel of an object in one fluorescent channel (e.g. Channel X) to the nearest fluorescent signal 
in another channel (e.g Channel Y). Each object detected in Channel X may have thousands of perimeter pixels and therefore has
perimeter distance (PD) measurements (as described ). As shown in the figure below, a PD measurment is 
thousands of PD measurments. We show in our [preprint](url), that taking the mean of these measurements (PD<sub>mean</sub>) describes the position of the 
object in Channel X relative to objects in Channel Y. Taking the maximum (Hausdorff Distance) and the minimum (PD<sub>min</sub>) PD
measurement *can* also provide useful information, the PD<sub>mean</sub> measurement performed 
most effectively in our [tests](url) and therefore is our recommended statistic.

PyBioProx is provided as an extensible Python module or as a GUI that can be run from the command line.

**Figure 1**  - An illustrative example in which a 3D (blue) object contains 12 perimeter voxels. The numbers within each
perimeter voexl show the PD measurement for each voxel relative to the red objects.
The smallest PD measurment represents the PD<sub>min</sub>, the largest PD measurment represents
the Hausdorff Distance, the mean PD measurement represents the PD<sub>mean</sub>. 

# Downloading and launching the GUI

The following steps describe how to install and launch the PyBioprox GUI

1. The PyBioProx GUI requires [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to be installed. Note, that in order to run PyBioProx from the command line 
Python must be added to the [PATH](https://datatofish.com/add-python-to-windows-path/), this can be done during 
installation. Alternatively, the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) distribution can be installed, allowing PyBioProx to be launched from Anaconda Prompt.
